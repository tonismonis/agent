// ===========================================================================
// Store contracts
// ===========================================================================
//
// EVOLUTION POLICY
// ----------------
// These store interfaces are the compatibility surface between the core
// middleware and every backend — the in-memory reference store and every
// adapter an application writes against its own database.
//
//   - Store METHODS are REQUIRED. A new method is a breaking contract change:
//     every adapter gets a compile error and implements it. Do NOT add methods
//     as optional-and-feature-detected (`store.method?.(...)`) — an adapter
//     that has not implemented one is then indistinguishable from one whose
//     answer is legitimately empty, so the feature silently does nothing in
//     production instead of failing at build time. `findActiveRun` was optional
//     for exactly one release cycle and cost us precisely that: reconnect
//     degraded to "no active run" on every backend that had not caught up.
//   - Capability tiers belong at the STORE level, not the method level. A
//     backend that only stores a transcript declares `ChatTranscriptStores`
//     (no `runs`); it does not declare a half-implemented `RunStore`.
//   - Never tighten an existing method's required arguments or widen its
//     required return shape in a breaking way.
//
// The shared conformance testkit (`./testkit/conformance.ts`) is the
// authoritative compatibility gate: every invariant documented on the methods
// below is asserted there, and every backend runs the identical suite. If an
// invariant is not encoded in the testkit, adapters cannot discover it — so
// promote new invariants into both the JSDoc here AND the testkit.
//
// TIMESTAMP CONVENTION
// --------------------
// Store *records* (`RunRecord`, `InterruptRecord`, `ArtifactRecord`,
// `BlobRecord`) speak **epoch milliseconds** (`number`), the native unit for
// SQL/`BIGINT` columns and `Date.now()`. Wire/result references that leave the
// persistence layer (e.g. core's `PersistedArtifactRef.createdAt`) speak
// **ISO-8601 strings**. The middleware performs the number→ISO conversion at
// the boundary; do not mix the two on a single field.
